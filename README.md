## Important

This project is a fork of [Feefo.NET](https://github.com/kevbite/Feefo.NET) which has been migrated to support .Net Core 3.1

## Getting started

Feefo.NET can be installed via the package manager console by executing the following commandlet

```powershell
PM> Install-Package Feefo
```

Once we've got the Feefo package installed, we need to create a `FeefoClient` object, this is the client that we will use for all interactions to Feefo.
The `FeefoClient` requires a `FeefoSettings` to passed in to its constructor which contains the logon details.

```csharp
var feefoSettings = new FeefoSettings("www.examplesupplier.com");
var client = new FeefoClient(feefoSettings);
```

You can also specify the BaseUri within the FeefoSettings if you wish to connect through your own layer of caching:

```csharp
var feefoSettings = new FeefoSettings(new Uri("http://feefo.examplesupplier.com/feefo/xmlfeed.jsp"), "www.examplesupplier.com");
```

## Fetching feedback

To fetch feedback from feefo we can call the `GetFeedbackAsync` method on the `FeefoClient`:

```csharp
var response = await client.GetFeedbackAsync();
```

You can also vary what Feefo sends back by passing in a `FeedbackRequest` object in to the `GetFeedbackAsync` method:

```csharp
var feedbackRequest = new FeedbackRequest()
{
    Limit = 50,
    Mode = Mode.ServiceAndProduct,
    Sort = new Sort(SortBy.Date, Order.Ascending),
    Since = Since.Month
};

var response = await client.GetFeedbackAsync(feedbackRequest);
```

### Client response

The `response` contains a `FeedbackList` which contains a list of `Feedback` and `Summary`.

Each feedback is the feedback submitted by the customer which will contains the following properties:

| Property              | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
